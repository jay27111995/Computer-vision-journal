# Computer-vision-journal
The repository contains code which documents my computer vision learning journey. Right now most of the code is in python but I might shift to C++ in the near future. 

I started this project on 6/11/20 and will 
constantly update it as I go. 

What to do the next time ?
    Try to learn image processing techniques, filters, 
    features. Its okay if you directly jump to features 
    it still hooks you on to image processing and computer 
    vision and you can later come back to learn more.
